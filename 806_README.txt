
To save you some reading, this document merely explains each column's contents in context of this file. Let me know if you want to know more behind the exprimental design, but I think this should include everything you might need to start making some figures. 

Site - name of site

Tree # - each site had 36 trees selected and randomly divided into 4 treatment groups 

Treatment - there are 9 trees in each treatment group
 - MJ -> induces defenses against insects herbivory (irrelavant to the data here)
- BTH -> induces defenses against necrotizing pathogens (like neonectria!)
 - MJ+BTH -> a combined application of both solutions
 - C -> a control solution of water

Innoculation - each tree received 9 innoculations at the same time
 - C -> control, sterile agar 
 - D -> short hand for the DUR1 1.1.1 isolate used; Neonectria ditissima (a generalist pathogen)
 - M -> short hand for the MES1 18.1.1 isolate used; Neonectria faginata (a specialist pathogen that only attacks American beech)

Note that each of the 3 innoculations are replicated 3 times per treated tree - these can be averaged to determine the average lesion size for each innoculation of that tree.

Harvesting - This is the confusing part so please contact me with any questions:

Terminology: 
Ei - early innoculation
Li - late innoculation
E or EH - early harvest (3 months post Ei)
L or LH - late harvest (6 months post Ei/3 months post Li respectively)

All trees received a late innoculation (Li) which was harvested 3 months later at the late harvest date (L).

2/3 of the trees (24) received early innoculation (Ei), with 1/3 NOT receiving Ei, only Li (12) (there will be NAs for the missing Ei data). 

Of the trees that received Ei (24), half (12) were harvest early (E), three months after innoculation. The remaining half (12) were harvested at the same time as the Li, 6 months after innoculation for the Ei (L).

This breaks down into three categories:

No Ei, LiLH -> 12
EiLH, LiLH - > 12
EiEH, LiLH - > 12

Ei_ID and Li_ID - just the image ids for the lesion pictures, these can be hidden/deleted/ignored

Ei_Lesion Area (mm) and Li_Lesion Area (mm) is the square millimeter area of each lesion for the Ei and Li respectively, with NAs for the trees that did not receive Ei.
